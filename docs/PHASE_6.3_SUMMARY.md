# Phase 6.3: Performance Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 6.3 has been successfully implemented, adding comprehensive performance optimizations across the database, API, and frontend layers of the ERP/MRP system.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Performance Optimizations

#### Indexes Added
- **BomItem**: category, currentStock/reorderPoint composite, supplier
- **SalesOrder**: timePeriod/productId composite for demand forecasting
- **ProductionSchedule**: status/startDate composite, productId/status composite
- **MaterialRequirement**: partNumber/status composite
- **Alert**: status/severity/createdAt composite, alertType/status composite

**Migration Status**: Created but NOT applied (manual step required)
- Location: `prisma/migrations/20251025030804_add_performance_indexes/`
- To apply: `npx prisma migrate dev`

#### Optimized Query Utilities
Created `src/lib/database/optimized-queries.ts` with:
- **bomQueries**: Paginated items, inventory value, low stock detection
- **scheduleQueries**: Active schedules, MRP data, date range filtering
- **alertQueries**: Active alerts with filtering, statistics
- **throughputQueries**: Date range data, average efficiency
- **inventoryQueries**: Recent movements, date range queries
- **salesQueries**: Priority filtering, demand forecasting

**Benefits**:
- Field selection reduces data transfer
- Efficient joins with minimal overhead
- Built-in pagination
- Indexed query paths

#### Connection Pooling
Updated `src/lib/database/client.ts` with:
- Singleton pattern for Prisma client
- Graceful shutdown handlers
- PostgreSQL connection pooling support (documented in .env.example)
- Development vs production logging

### 2. API Response Caching

#### In-Memory Cache System
Created `src/lib/cache/simple-cache.ts` with:
- TTL-based expiration (configurable per key)
- Pattern-based invalidation
- Automatic cleanup (5-minute intervals)
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- Helper function `withCache()` for easy integration

#### Cache Key Structure
Organized cache keys by domain:
- Dashboard: KPIs, alerts, production data
- BOM: Lists, items, low stock, inventory value
- Schedule: Active, by ID, by date range
- Sales: Forecasts, priority orders
- Throughput: Product data, date ranges

#### Invalidation Strategy
- Mutation endpoints automatically invalidate related caches
- Pattern-based invalidation for efficiency
- Granular invalidation by ID when possible

**Production Note**: Current implementation is in-memory (single instance). For multi-instance deployments, replace with Redis.

### 3. Frontend Optimizations

#### Next.js Configuration Updates
Updated `next.config.js` with:
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip for all responses
- **Image Optimization**: AVIF/WebP formats, device-specific sizes
- **Package Import Optimization**: lucide-react, date-fns
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production
- **Bundle Analyzer**: Integrated with `ANALYZE=true` flag

#### Dynamic Imports Guide
Created `src/lib/performance/README.md` documenting:
- How to use dynamic imports
- When to lazy-load components
- Example patterns for charts, tables, heavy libraries
- Server Components vs Client Components strategy

#### Bundle Analysis Setup
- Installed `@next/bundle-analyzer`
- Configured in next.config.js
- Added `npm run analyze` script
- Documentation on interpreting results

### 4. Performance Monitoring

#### PerformanceMonitor Class
Created `src/lib/monitoring/performance.ts` with:
- **measureAsync()**: Track async operations
- **measure()**: Track sync operations
- **withPerformanceLogging()**: API route wrapper
- **PerformanceTimer**: Multi-stage operation tracking
- Automatic slow operation detection (>1s threshold)
- Statistics and metrics collection
- Production monitoring integration ready

#### Key Features
- Console logging with color-coded warnings
- In-memory metrics storage (last 1000 operations)
- Integration hooks for external monitoring services
- Performance statistics by operation name
- Configurable slow operation thresholds

### 5. Documentation

#### Performance Guide
Created `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` covering:
- All database optimizations and indexes
- Caching implementation and usage
- Frontend optimization techniques
- Performance monitoring setup
- Bundle analysis guide
- Performance targets and benchmarks
- Testing and validation strategies
- Troubleshooting guide

#### Quick Reference
Created `src/lib/performance/README.md` with:
- Dynamic imports examples
- Caching patterns
- Query optimization tips
- Best practices
- Performance targets

### 6. Performance Testing

#### Test Script
Created `scripts/performance-test.ts` with:
- API endpoint performance tests
- Database query performance tests
- Automatic pass/fail based on targets
- Summary statistics
- Slowest operation tracking

#### Test Targets
- Dashboard KPIs: <500ms
- BOM List: <300ms
- Production Schedules: <400ms
- Active Alerts: <200ms
- Chart Data: <400ms
- Database lookups: <50ms
- Aggregations: <200ms

#### Usage
```bash
# Test API endpoints (requires dev server running)
npm run perf:test

# Test database queries only
npm run perf:test db
```
